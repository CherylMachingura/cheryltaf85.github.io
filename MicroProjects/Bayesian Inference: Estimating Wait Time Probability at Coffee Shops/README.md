# 📊 Bayesian Inference: Estimating Wait Time Probability at Coffee Shops

This project simulates a customer satisfaction scenario where we use **Bayesian updating** to estimate the probability that a customer will experience a long wait time at a coffee shop.

## 📌 Problem Statement

You manage a chain of coffee shops and want to estimate how likely it is for customers to experience long wait times based on incoming feedback.

## 🧪 Methodology

- Use a **Beta prior** representing your initial belief (e.g., 50/50 odds)
- Simulate 50 customer responses (long vs short wait)
- Update the prior to posterior using the **Beta-Binomial model**
- Visualize how your belief changes over time

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- `scipy.stats.beta` for posterior calculations
- `matplotlib` for layered posterior plots

## 📊 Visualizations

- Density plots of the prior and multiple posterior distributions
- Evolution of belief after 10, 20, 30, 50 responses

## 📂 Files

- `bayesian_update_wait_times.ipynb`: Full implementation and simulation
- `README.md`: This project overview

## ✅ Output Insight

The updated posterior suggests a ~70% chance of customers experiencing a long wait time, aligning with the simulated reality.

## 📚 Concepts

- Bayesian inference
- Beta-Binomial modeling
- Real-time belief updating based on evidence
