# 🧬 Genetic Algorithm: Optimal Social Media Posting Time

This project applies a genetic algorithm to solve a real-world problem: **determining the best time of day to post on social media** to maximize engagement.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Social media engagement fluctuates throughout the day. Using synthetic engagement data, we simulate the number of likes, comments, and shares across 24 hours and use a genetic algorithm to discover the most optimal posting time.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- Genetic Algorithm: selection, crossover, mutation
- Fitness function defined as engagement score
- Convergence tracking over generations

## 📊 Visualizations

- Heatmap-style bar chart of engagement by hour
- Convergence plot showing evolution of fitness
- Final recommended optimal posting hour

## 📂 Files

- `genetic_algorithm_optimize_posting_time.ipynb`: Full code and analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells to view visuals and final result

## ✅ Output

```text
Optimal hour to post: 15:00
