# 📱 Teenagers and Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes how Gen Z and teenagers express themselves online using modern slang, memes, and cultural references (e.g., "sigma," "reez," "NPC"). It uses sentiment analysis on a simulated set of 100 teen social media posts to classify emotional tone and visualize patterns.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify trends in teen emotional expression online by:
- Categorizing posts as Positive, Neutral, or Negative
- Visualizing sentiment distribution
- Generating word clouds of common phrases used in each sentiment type

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with `TextBlob`
- **WordClouds** to highlight emotional vocabulary
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for stylish, publication-ready plots

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **Sentiment Distribution Chart** with enhanced style and formatting
- **Word Clouds** for positive and negative posts with framed layouts and custom color palettes
