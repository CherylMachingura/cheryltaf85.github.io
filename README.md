## üíº &nbsp;Projects

Here are some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on, showcasing my experience in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **predictive modeling**.

### **1. Customer Churn Prediction**  
*Business Problem:*  
Predicting customer churn helps financial institutions reduce customer attrition and improve retention strategies. This project utilized machine learning techniques to predict which customers were likely to churn.

*Approach/Methodology:*  
- **Dataset:** BankChurners.csv  
- **Techniques:** Logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.  
- **Result:** Achieved 85% accuracy with the Random Forest model. Key predictors included credit utilization and transaction frequency.
